Example for Genero 3.0 EAP using the new WANTFIXEDPAGESIZE=NO attribute for Scrollgrid

Run the example and try and attempt to resize the window. 
In the first example, the number of rows is fixed
In the second example, the addition of WANTFIXEDPAGESIZE=NO means the number of rows
will increase/decrease to fit the space available.

NOTE: At moment this only works if Scrollgrid does not have any explicit text
in it, note how I have used LABELS that are in the array
