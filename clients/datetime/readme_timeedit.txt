Example for Genero 3.0 EAP using new seconds on timeedit feature

Previously timeedits were always hh:mm:ss
Now the widget determines if it is appropriate to determine seconds and will 
only do so if datetime hour to second.  Datetime hour to minute will 
display and input hh:mm only

Run in 2.50 to see the old behaviour
